# Global Notifications

Just a small JS project that creates a custom event to show messages.
buttons generate custom events that the container listens to.
timeout functionality so events are removed and notifications re-rendered.
All UI elements build in js so no need to pass ugly strings.



It works in IE 11 ðŸ˜Š

|Still To come|
|-------------|
|Add option to pass selector instead of creating container|
|Allow implementer to pass their own function that builds notification|
|Ability to add custom classes to notification or better style control|
|Create and NPM library for custom installs|
|Allow Angular and React to use Custom Event without type errors|
